Introduction
============

This library is an Actionscript 3 library for advanced games. It 
includes tools for basic game management, including hierarchical sets of
views for easy implementation of nested UI's pausing, key management and 
so on.

It also has a library for AI, particularly behavior trees. The behavior 
tree code is described in the book Artificial Intelligence for Games, 
Second Edition, by Ian Millington and John Funge (Morgan Kaufmann 2009).
